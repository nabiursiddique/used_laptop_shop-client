        question: "Why checking all component is important when buying a used laptop?",
        answer: "When we buy a new laptop we don't need to worry about anything because there is minimum 1 year warranty included. But when we are buying a used laptop it doesn't have a warranty that why we need to check all the things in the shop or maximum a used laptop gets 30 days of warranty period.so we need to check everything in a proper way. We will discuss this in our other blog."

        question: "What are things that need to check when buying a used laptop?",
        answer: "After buying a used laptop the first thing we should check is the outside condtion of the laptop. We need to check if there is any scratch or dent in the laptop or not.Then the color of the laptop is orginal painting or not(It's a little complicated to check the color). After checking the outer part of the laptop we need to check the display of the laptop is there any dent or any pixel burn in the display or not. Then we should check the kayboard and with the help of the keyboard testing website we can check that all key of the website are working perfectly or not. After that we need to check the trackpad and then we have to check the battery capacity and how much time the laptop runs with a full charge. If a used laptop passes all the test then it should be working fine.But there are also some other things to check like wifi, bluetooth, GPS and etc."
